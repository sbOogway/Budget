## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Assets section**: Track non-cash assets (real estate, vehicles, jewelry, collectibles) with value snapshots, appreciation/depreciation projections, and net worth integration ([#52](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/52))
  - CRUD management with 11 REST endpoints
  - Value history charts and projection charts
  - Dashboard hero tile for total asset worth
  - Net worth and factory reset integration

### Fixed
- Parent category dropdown showing wrong type when creating Income categories ([#53](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/53))

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Cryptocurrency account type**: Static cryptocurrency tracking with 25 supported currencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, DOGE, etc.), correct decimal precision, and encrypted wallet address field ([#47](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/47))
- **Multi-currency dashboard aggregations**: Hero tiles, net worth, trend data, and cash flow reports convert all account values to the user's default currency before summing. Exchange rates fetched from ECB (fiat) and CoinGecko (crypto) with daily background updates ([#52](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/52))
- **Recurring bill end dates**: Optional end date or remaining payment count on bills; bills auto-deactivate when conditions are met and annual overview respects constraints ([#46](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/46))
- **Unit tests**: 133 new tests across AccountService, AuthService, CategoryService, TagSetService, and TransactionService

### Fixed
- Bill mark-as-paid now uses the bill's due date instead of today's date, preventing wrong billing period from being marked paid ([#51](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/51))
- Bill status badge colors use explicit values instead of Nextcloud CSS variables for reliable contrast ([#51](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/51))
- Blank pagination pages after bulk actions caused by `?int` category parameter discarding 'uncategorized' string value; reset page to 1 after bulk operations ([#50](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/50))
- CSV date parsing for DD/MM/YYYY format ([#48](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/48))
- Bill date timezone bug and added one-time bill frequency ([#39](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/39))
- Pension edit modal redesigned with form-section layout; fixed missing field persistence for expectedReturnRate, retirementAge, and transferValue
- Pension summary and projections now convert to base currency before aggregating
- Dashboard pension worth tile uses base currency instead of first account's currency
- `getPrimaryCurrency()` replaced with user's `default_currency` setting instead of balance-weighted heuristic
- Income summary API returns correct keys for page tiles (expectedThisMonth, monthlyTotal, receivedThisMonth, activeCount)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- CSV import crash (`array_combine()` error) when bank exports include metadata preamble rows before column headers (e.g. Swiss bank CSVs) ([#11](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/11))
- UTF-8 BOM in CSV files polluting the first column header name

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-19

- PostgreSQL compatibility: cast date column to CHAR before SUBSTR for month extraction ([#41](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/41))
- Reports: exclude transfers from aggregate income/expense totals in all-accounts view to prevent double-counting

### Removed
- Non-functional in-app theme toggle (light/dark/system) — the app correctly inherits Nextcloud's global theme via CSS variables ([#44](https://github.com/otherworld-dev/budget/issues/44))
- Hardcoded dark mode CSS overrides from rules builder components

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-09

## [1.0.33] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- Duplicate transaction detection completely broken during statement imports (GitHub issue #6)
- OFX FITID (bank transaction ID) was lost during transaction mapping, preventing bank-provided duplicate detection
- Import IDs used random file identifiers instead of content hashing, causing same transaction to generate different IDs
- Preview methods didn't generate import IDs before duplicate checking, so duplicates were never detected in preview
- Import preview showed no indication of which transactions were duplicates
- "Show duplicates" and "Show uncategorized" checkboxes had no effect on preview display
- Wrong checkbox ID used in JavaScript ('skip-duplicates' vs 'show-duplicates')
- Error status badges and balance amounts too dark to read (GitHub issue #8)
- Installation failure on PostgreSQL: "Column is type Bool and also NotNull, so it can not store false" (GitHub issue #5)
- Migration Version001000017 used `notnull => true` for boolean columns, violating Nextcloud's cross-database compatibility requirements
